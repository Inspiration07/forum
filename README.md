Simple Implementation of a Q&amp;A Forum website

# Abstract
Gone are the days of traditional teaching approach, where the teacher can only answer students’ questions when they are in the lecture or when the students have to explicitly go to the teacher to clarify their doubts. This simple implementation of forum will help the student to ask/post their doubts/questions and the teacher can reply to those questions on the forum. Other students can also see what are the questions asked and hence understand the topic in even greater depth. 

This way we can save a lot of physical effort and utilize time in an efficient manner. 
After all, there should not be any kind of hindrance in a student’s education.
